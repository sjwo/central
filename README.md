# Central: canonical parameter specification

This is a semi-abandoned work-in-progress learning exercise in macros with the vague goal of providing tools for defining parameters once, and programmatically generating everything that depends on their definitions (e.g., cli argument parsing, among other things).

Do not use, or expect any kind of stability.

`Always eventually exists unannounced breaking change.'
